-- The casting relation v ↪_A v' (Eᵢ Figure 3), adapted to de Bruijn closures.  Casting is
-- deliberately typing-free: its premises mention only the closure's own annotations, never
-- a typing derivation — Consistent is defined from casting and consumed by typing, so a
-- typed cast would collapse that stratification.

  -- The one new rule for type abstraction: casting at a brand is the identity on values
  -- already branded at it, and undefined on everything else.  Casting must NOT be able to
  -- *produce* a brand from an arbitrary value (`v ↪_{α_n} ⟨n⟩v`): then every value would
  -- cast at α_n, `disjoint_consistent` would fail (5 and {l = 3} are typed at disjoint
  -- types yet would cast at α_n to different values), and with it `tmergev` and
  -- preservation.  Branding is therefore installed by `seal`, never by a cast.

  -- Casting a fixpoint closure rewrites only the EXTERNAL codomain Bx; the internal B is
  -- pinned because the body's context mentions (A → B) and beta reinstalls the
